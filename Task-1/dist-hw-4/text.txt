Homework 4, Part 1

I used the Hardhat network.

While generating 100 transactions, I saved their hashes in a CSV file.
Then, I used web3.py in Google Colab to get the gas used for each transaction
Hashes from the file and built a graph based on the results.

The work was done on a remote server, so Google Colab had access to my local network.
